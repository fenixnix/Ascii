 What`s Going On?!

 Agenda. Stage 1

Doom: 3. Clues: –

---
It is late at night. You are holed up in your study, researching the bloody disappearances that have been taking place in the region. A few hours into your research, you hear the sound of strange chanting coming from your parlor, down the hall. At the same time, you hear dirt churning, as if something were digging beneath the floor.

A Lapse in Time - Back
---
Your house continues to change before your very eyes. The walls have decayed, and the ground in many rooms has turned to dirt. It is almost as if you have been transported somewhere else entirely, although every now and again you recognize elements of your former home.

```The lead investigator must decide (choose one): Either each investigator discards 1 card at random from his or her hand, or the lead investigator takes 2 horror.```

Rise of the Ghouls
---
Agenda. Stage 2

Doom: 7. Clues: –

---
The floor beneath you is giving way, and you see a vast network of tunnels, twisting into the darkness below. Shapes and silhouettes of strange creatures move swiftly through the tunnels, trying to find a way up. You probably don't want to be here when they do...

The Tunnels Below - Back
---
A feral beast, roughly humanoid with a canine cast and hooves for feet, tears through the ground in front of you. Below the floor, you can see vast tunnels beneath your house. Fiendish howling echoes from deep within the underground caverns.

```Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck. Discard cards from the top of the encounter deck until a Ghoul enemy is discarded. The lead investigator draws that enemy.```

They're Getting Out!
---
Agenda. Stage 3

Doom: 10. Clues: –

---
You hear a crazed howl outside, and suddenly all the creatures turn their attention to that sound. They rush to escape the house, breaking down doors and clawing at everything in their way.

---
Forced - At the end of the enemy phase: Each unengaged Ghoul enemy moves 1 location towards the Parlor.

Forced - At the end of the round: Place 1 doom on this agenda for each Ghoul enemy in the Hallway or Parlor.

The Ghouls Break Free - Back
---
The ground begins to shake and you can see claws rising up from the dirt as uncanny creatures desperately try to claw their way out of the ground all around you. Everywhere you turn, you see monsters rising from the earth. Terrified, you flee as fast as you can.

```
— If the investigators are at Act 1 or 2, they are trapped inside the house as the ghouls tear them apart. (→R3)

— If the investigators are at Act 3, they barely escape with their lives, allowing the ghouls to run rampant. Each investigator that has not resigned is defeated and suffers 1 physical trauma.

Trapped
The Door on the Floor - Back
Act
You notice that the edges of your newly purchased rug are tattered and mud-stained. Finding this odd, you shift the furniture aside and pull back the rug. To your surprise, you see the door leading out of your study. You slowly turn the knob, and the door swings open, revealing your hallway below.
You jump through the doorway, landing on your feet on soft dirt. The door to the study slams shut above you. The smell of burning wood fills the narrow hall, intermingled with the scent of rot and decay.
Put into play the set-aside Hallway, Cellar, Attic, and Parlor.

Discard each enemy in the Study.

Place each investigator in the Hallway.

Remove the Study from the game.


The Barrier
Mythos
Act. Stage 2
Clues: 3.
A glowing barrier blocks the path to your parlor. As you move toward it, intense heat forces you to back away. Picking up a handful of dirt, you toss it as the barrier and watch in horror as the dirt incinerates. Perhaps there's something in the cellar or attic that can help.
Objective - When the round ends, investigators in the hallway may, as a group, spend the requisite number of clues to advance.

What Have You Done?
Mythos
Act. Stage 3
Clues: –
A woman with a torch stands in your parlor, a glimmer of hatred in her eyes. "What have you done to my barrier?" she screams, furious. Before you can enter, a ghastly wail sounds behind you, and a creature wearing robes and a deer skull mask tears through the wall, advancing towards you.
Objective - If the Ghoul Priest is Defeated, advance.

What Have You Done?
Defending the Home - Back
Act
When the robed creature falls, the fiendish swarm burrows back into the ground and the chaos of the house quiets. But the stranger in your parlor chamber doesn't seem relieved.
"You broke my seal that was set to trap the ghouls within." She raises her torch. "Now, we must take more direct measures and burn this hell-pit to the ground!"
The lead investigator must decide (choose one):

— It was never much of a home. Burn it down! (→R1)

— This hell-pit is my home! No way are we burning it! (→R2)
